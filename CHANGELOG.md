### Added

#### Smart Genre Tag Management
- **Automatic Genre Tag Removal** - When tracks are manually removed from genre master playlists, their genre tags are automatically removed from the track's stored genres
- **Genre Master Playlist Cleanup** - Genre master playlists now automatically remove tracks that don't match the genre (prevents accumulation of incorrect tracks)

- **Removed Problematic Emojis** - Replaced stereotypical emojis with more inclusive alternatives (e.g., Latin genre emoji updated)

### Changed

#### Genre Master Playlist Behavior
- **Automatic Track Removal** - Genre master playlists now remove tracks that don't match the genre (only for liked songs, preserves manually added non-liked tracks)

- **Sync Helper Module** - New `spotim8/scripts/common/sync_helpers.py` module for shared sync functionality

### Fixed

### Technical Improvements

- **Better Error Handling** - Improved error handling in playlist update operations
